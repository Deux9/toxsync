#Toxsync

This bash script is intended to be used for syncing tox datafiles PGP encrypted. The encrypted file will then be placed in a specific path from where it might be synced to a cloud or whatever. This shouldn't be a problem due to the PGP encryption.

##Usage
Edit the first section of the script for configuration.
You can use arguments "toxsync [client] [profile]"

##TODO
- add uTox
- add simple help
